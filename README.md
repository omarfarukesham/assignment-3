# Blog Project: Assignment Requirements

## Overview

The goal of this assignment is to develop a backend for a blogging platform where users can write, update, and delete their blogs. The system will have two roles: **Admin** and **User**. The Admin has special permissions to manage users and their blogs, while users can perform CRUD operations on their own blogs. The backend will include secure authentication, role-based access control, and a public API for viewing blogs with search, sort, and filter functionalities.

## Technologies

*   **TypeScript**
*   **Node.js**
*   **Express.js**
*   **MongoDB with Mongoose**

## Bonus Section

### 1\. Error Handling

Error handling is crucial in ensuring that an application responds gracefully to unexpected situations, providing users with meaningful feedback while maintaining system stability. A well-structured error response format helps in identifying and diagnosing issues effectively.

#### Common Error Response Format

To maintain consistency across all API endpoints, the following error response structure will be used:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message describing the issue",
  "statusCode": 400, // or other relevant HTTP status code
  "error": {"details": "Additional error details, if applicable"},
  "stack": "error stack trace, if available"
}
```

#### Types of Errors Handled

The following common errors will be managed with appropriate responses:

*   **Zod Validation Error** (`ZOD_ERROR`): Errors arising from invalid data inputs based on Zod schema validation.
*   **Not Found Error** (`NOT_FOUND_ERROR`): When requested resources (e.g., a user, item, or page) are not found.
*   **Validation Error** (`VALIDATION_ERROR`): General validation errors (e.g., incorrect data format, missing required fields).
*   **Authentication Error** (`AUTH_ERROR`): Issues related to failed authentication (e.g., invalid token or expired session).
*   **Authorization Error** (`AUTHORIZATION_ERROR`): When the user lacks the necessary permissions to access a resource.
*   **Internal Server Error** (`INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`): Unhandled errors or unexpected server issues.

By consistently implementing these error handling mechanisms, we ensure a smooth user experience and easier debugging for developers.
